# reverse_ecology

This repository includes a series of scripts illustrating or predicting microbial physiology based on genome/proteome sequences. 

* "amino_acid_usage.pl" calculates amino acid usage and frequencies from proteome sequences.
* "IVYWREL2_4_fasta_dir.pl" calculates predicted optimal growth temperature (OGT) based on frequencies of seven amino acids "IVYWREL" from proteome sequences.
